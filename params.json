  "name": "Spell checker",
  "tagline": "The spell checker works by:  reading in and tokenizing a vocabulary of correctly spelled words, reading in, cleaning, and tokenizing the piece of text we want spell checked, comparing each word (token) in the piece of text with each word in the vocabulary and  returning the ones that weren't found (incorrectly spelled words). The file dictionary.txt contains a sequence of  correctly spelled words, which we'll use to seed our vocabulary. The file story.txt  is a piece of text containing some misspelled words. In the following code cell, we added  the spell checker we wrote so far from the previous mission.",
